# HeaderNav

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2.

This is an example of a header and nav bar in an angular app.

To use it:
- Add the `layout.scss` into your project. These can be used elsewhere to keep your padding sizes consistent by importing the file into other scss files.
- Add the whole `navigation` directory to your project
- Import `NavigationComponent` into your `AppModule`
- Reference `ml-navigation` (usually from `app.component.html`).

### Navigation Component Parameters: 
| name  | description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| title | The title to display |


---

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
